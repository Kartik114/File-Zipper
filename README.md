# File-Zipper

This Project is based on Huffman Coding , a lossless compression Algorithm. It can be used to Compress and Decompress any text files.
Huffman coding is a bottom up Greedy Algorithm implemented using concept of Tries.

## Implementation in Project:

This Project contains two functions:
1.Encode: Compress input file passed.
2.Decode: Decopress Huffman coded file to its original file.

 
 ## How to run this project?
 
 To run this project , you need to make an executable file:
 
 1.For compressing:

 2. For Decompressing:

## Conclusion: 

This project is just an implementation of Huffman coding, it is not as efficient as the compression algorithm used currently to compress files.
Example: inputFile.txt (42KB) is compressed to compressedFile.huf (25KB) file and decompressed back to ouputFile.txt (42KB) and similar for larger files.
